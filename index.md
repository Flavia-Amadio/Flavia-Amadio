## Introduction
I am a PhD student at the University of Copenhagen and University of Leuven. The goal of my project is to study the impact of irradiation and stellar variability in the chemical and physical structure of the exoplanet’s atmosphere. I will work on the self-consistent inclusion of irradiation in the stellar code [MARCS code](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...486..951G/abstract).
